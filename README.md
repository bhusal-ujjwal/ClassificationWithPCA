# ClassificationWithPCA
Classify the Wine dataset 

the dataset target is in the column "Customer_Segment" which can be 1, 2, or 3,
the features include alcohol percentage, Ash, Ash_alcanity, Magnesium, and other features related to the wine.

Load the data, then see if it needs cleaning or so, then using the PCA technique, reduce the dimension of the features into two components, and then try to classify the data using LogisticRegression

Print out the accuracy of your model using confusion matrix and classification report
Also, plot a scatter plot using seaborn or any other preferred library of the 2-dimensional data you made with the predicted target.
